## Description
ðŸŽ² Roll your dice and reach one hundred to win ðŸ’¯. Compete with your friends ðŸ‘Š and see who gets the higher score, the higher your roll the better. If your dice hits 'one' your score is zeroed, and it's the other player turn. You can always hit 'hold' which will freeze your score till your next turn.
